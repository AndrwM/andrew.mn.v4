      Iâ€™m fascinated by the engineering that powers user interfaces and love helping product teams and startups create seamless user experiences. Iâ€™m fully capable in design and frontend engineer, but I can also dive into the server-side to build out modeling or functionality related to interface needs.

      I can play many roles, but Iâ€™m most effective bridging the gap between engineering and design. Iâ€™m valuable both as a designer on an engineering team and as an engineer on a design team, both core assets of any software company.
